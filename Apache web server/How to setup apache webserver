here is how you can turn your ubuntu to a webserver by simply installing the apache2



sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2


now to start the server to work, as /var/www/html/index.html indicates:
The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the default configuration. 

so to start the webserver with the default conf, you should use :

apache2ctl
