The good news first: There are alot of Icons in /usr/share/icons  :)




Creating a shortcut for your scripts or binary files are pretty straightforward.
Note that in your file, you should have the shebang line (#! /.../bash or #! /.../python etc).

To do so, you need to create a file called yourapp.desktop 
You can find the template of that file in the same folder that this note is.
Here is the template of that file :


[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Exec=/home/ali/Programms/MATLAB/bin/matlab
Name=Matlab
Comment=Matlab
Icon=/home/ali/Programms/MATLAB/ui/install/installer_login/images/apple-icons/apple-touch-icon-144x144.png

yeah! it is very simple. just replace the information with yours. The you should put this file at /usr/share/applications. Since, to do so, you need the roop previlages, you can use "sudo cp yourapp.desktop /usr/share/applications" in your terminal.
