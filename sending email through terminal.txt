for this purpose you can use the ssmtp.

first of all try to install the mailutils :
    sudo apt-get install mailutils
note that set your settings on the appearing window to the second one.


now install sstp:
    sudo apt-get install ssmtp
    


now open the configuration file :
    sudo gedit /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
        or
    sudo nano /etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf
    
    

and then change the file to this :
      root=ali.fele@gmail.com
      mailhub=smtp.gmail.com:587
      hostname=ali-Lenovo-v310-15ISK
      AuthUser=ali.fele@gmail.com
      AuthPass=1362290696Afp
      UseSTARTTLS=Yes
      UseTLS=Yes
      
      
      
now the most important thing to do is changing a security setting in your google
account.

go to google account. then to the security tab. In the list look for Less secure app access and turn it on.
