mplayer  --> for playing the videos
ffmpeg --> for the multimedia convertion
links2 --> the command line based browser
cmus --> the Command line base music player
mpg123 --> you can play mp3 files

	 One version of it is installed in the base env of conda. so you can

Edo sound effect:
Edo.mp4 is a video at : /opt/Edo/Edo.mp4 
Edo is a bash script at /usr/bin/Edo. Since this path is a path in the pathes of the bash ( you can check that by typing echo $PATH in the terminal). So, if you write Edo at your terminal, then the video will be played for you. I am using mplayer.

The shortcut for that in the xfce desktop env is 'ctr+alt+\'
