one of the most probable problems you may incounter is the permission problem 
the change the permission use can do a simple search (with chmod). Also for the owner change (with chown).


but note that in our case you should change both "user" and "group"
to do this simply run :

'''
sudo chown pi:pi <the name of the folder of file>
'''


Important Note:
note that if you change the permissions for a folder, the permission states of the subfolders will not change.


note:
you can check the owners and the permissions of the files and folders with the command:
'''
ls -l
'''
