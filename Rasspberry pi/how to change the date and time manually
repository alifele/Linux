some times in the rasspberry-pi it is needed to change the time and the date manually

you can run the following command:
'''
date -s '2014-12-25 12:34:56'
'''
(you can find the article here : https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/76182/set-manually-datetime-raspberry)


also this article is very verbose at the time setting of the raspberry-p
