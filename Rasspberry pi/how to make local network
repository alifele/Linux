for "headless" rasp:


in this case you should first connect the pi to your laptop directly. and then with this way connect to the wifi network that you want.
to connec the pi to your laptop directly, check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjghxhS_wcM

then you can connect to the wifi network from command line (it might be a little bit complex!)
and the other way to connect to the wifi network is stablishing vnc server connection to your pi and bringing up the GUI and then connecing
to the network from GUI.
also don't forget to enable the ssh interface. To do so you can type in the teminal of your pi : 'sudo raspi-config'. and then from the interfacing options you can enable the ssh inteface.


then go to the admin setting of your router (192.168.1.1). If you are using the hotspot of your smartphone devices, simply install a hotspot manager app on your smartphone and read the IP address of the pi in your local network.

now you can disconnect the lan cable, and connect to your pi with pi@IPADDRESS
